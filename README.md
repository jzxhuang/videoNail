## Usage
If you'd like to simply use the extension, [get it for free on the Chrome Web Store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/videonail/nbpbjchgemnjhcpomnbjkkcfloafbema).

If you'd like to contribute, work with the extension locally and make changes, clone/fork the repo and load the directory as an 'unpacked' extension in Chrome. If you aren't familiar with Chrome extensions, head over to the [Chrome developer site](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) to get started.

We have also included a bash script that packages all the core assets into a .zip file. To use it, your terminal must have the zip command installed (i.e. use a Unix OS).
