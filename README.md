## Usage
If you'd like to simply use the extension, get it for free on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/videonail/nbpbjchgemnjhcpomnbjkkcfloafbema) or [Firefox Web Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/videonail-floating-youtube/).

If you'd like to contribute, work with the extension locally and make changes, clone/fork the repo and load the directory as an 'unpacked' extension in Chrome or Firefox. If you aren't familiar with Chrome/Firefox extensions, head over to the [Chrome developer site](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted), or [Firefox developer site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension) to get started.

We have also included a bash script that packages all the core assets into a .zip file. To use it, your terminal must have the zip command installed (i.e. use a Unix OS).

## Contributing
